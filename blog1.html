    <p class="inner-blog-p">I am sanika and I am a self-taught developer. It all started with small java programs of palindrome numbers and factorials in 9th grade, who knew I would end up falling in love with coding.
    </p>

    <p class="inner-blog-p">I was introduced to programming in 9th grade. I had started with java as my first language. I found it pretty interesting. I started to explore coding and found there's a whole new world out there. I started learning python as it was said to be one of the easiest languages to start with as a beginner. I loved it due to its extensible behavior, and versatility. I made some mistakes while learning it which I would like for you to know so that you don't repeat them.

                <h2>Not maintaining consistency</h2>

                <p>I was good at coding but when I ran out of practice and decided to develop something again it felt like I had never learned the language. When you are not consistent at something, you run out of practice which brings you back down from where you started. To excel at something you have to be consistent at it.</p>
                <p>As Dwayne Jhonson said -“Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come.”

                <h2>Being stuck in the tutorial hell</h2>

                <p>I started learning to code through YouTube tutorials and it felt like I understood everything but when the time came to implement what I had learned, I went blank as if I never learned from the tutorials. The same happened a couple of times and that's when I realized that I was stuck in tutorial hell.
                </p>

                <p>When you start learning something, you have no idea whether or not you would be good at it. When you don't feel that you are ready to step out into the real world and develop something on your own you get stuck in the tutorial hell. To escape it, you have to get out of your comfort zone and develop something of your own. When you develop something by yourself, your mind has to fetch things you have learned from your brain for you to implement them. Little by little, when you start to get good at it, your confidence boosts up resulting in you wanting to develop more.

                <h2>Moving on to the next thing too soon</h2>

                <p>Never move on to the next thing until you have excelled in the current thing. This will give you the temporary satisfaction of learning new things but will make you go blank when it is time to implement them. Always practice everything well, get good at it and only then move on to the next thing.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>After having lots of ups and downs I was finally able to get the discipline needed to code. As a beginner, everything at the start feels impossible but gradually when things start to work out your confidence boots up which results in you getting better at what you do.</p>
